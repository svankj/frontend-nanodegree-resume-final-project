*Hello, some notes about my Resume project:*
* The basic project is a page with in it all the sections of the Resume. I decided to make a more complex structure to practice with css and javascript. So I splitted the sections of my Resume webpage in eight different pages.
* I used css to style the pages both with bootstrap framework for header and flex box for the pages.
* I used grunt to process the images and picture source to manage images for different devices and media queries for the style.
* In the pages I have included images, tables in page Languages, video and javascript to select content in page Interests (press "+"
to change Description section), in Contact page I have used the zocial icons.
* The structure of Resume is a main page with a header menu which pressing the names Me, Education, Work, Qualifications... changes the section page of Resume loading with a jquery function the right page.
* The only stuff that it is not mine is the map function taken from the course (I just made a little modification on infoWindow to show an image and a short description text) and the wait function when Me page is selected taken from web.
* I coded Resume project under Ubuntu 14.04 using Sublime Text and Chromium browser.
* [CSS validator](jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) passed except for the warning "can't find the warning message for vendor-extension".
* [Html validator](validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) for index.html passed except for minor warning.
